# 10 Improvement Techniques for Transformer Flow Matching

Ranked by projected performance impact (highest to lowest).

---

## 1. **Optimal Transport Flow (Rectified Flow)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +5-8 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.2x

**Rationale**: Rectified flow learns straighter paths in probability space, reducing sampling steps needed and improving reconstruction quality. For sparse data, straight paths mean better interpolation.

**Implementation**:
- Replace linear interpolation with optimal transport path
- Use reflow procedure: train → sample → retrain on sampled paths
- Minimal code change, maximum impact

**Key Papers**: "Flow Straight and Fast" (Liu et al., 2023)

## 2. **Multi-Scale Positional Encoding** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +4-7 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.0x (no overhead)

**Rationale**: Current Fourier encoding uses fixed frequencies. Multi-scale encoding captures both fine details and global structure, critical for sparse reconstruction.

**Implementation**:
- Use multiple frequency bands: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32] × base_freq
- Concat all scales: [coord, sin(2^0·coord), cos(2^0·coord), ..., sin(2^5·coord), cos(2^5·coord)]
- Increase d_model to accommodate richer encoding

---

## 3. **Consistency Loss** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +3-6 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.1x

**Rationale**: Enforce temporal consistency in the flow trajectory. If z_t and z_{t'} are on the same path, model predictions should be consistent.

**Implementation**:
- Sample two timesteps t1, t2 for same datapoint
- Loss = MSE(v_t1, v_t2) weighted by |t1 - t2|
- Regularizes flow to be smooth and coherent

**Key Papers**: "Consistency Models" (Song et al., 2023)

---

## 4. **Perceptual Loss (Frequency Domain)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +3-5 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.15x

**Rationale**: MSE loss treats all frequencies equally, but human perception is frequency-weighted. For sinusoidal data, frequency domain loss directly targets the signal structure.

**Implementation**:
- L_total = λ_mse · MSE(pred, target) + λ_freq · MSE(FFT(pred), FFT(target))
- Add spectral norm loss for high-frequency preservation
- λ_mse=1.0, λ_freq=0.5

**Key Papers**: "Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer" (Johnson et al., 2016)

---

## 5. **Adaptive Layernorm (AdaLN)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +2-5 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.05x

**Rationale**: Time-dependent normalization allows model to adapt processing based on diffusion timestep. Early timesteps (noisy) need different processing than late timesteps (clean).

**Implementation**:
- Replace LayerNorm with AdaLN: scale and shift conditioned on timestep t
- AdaLN(x, t) = LayerNorm(x) * (1 + scale(t)) + shift(t)
- Learn scale(t) and shift(t) as small MLPs

**Key Papers**: "DiT: Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers" (Peebles & Xie, 2023)

---

## 6. **Self-Conditioning** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +2-4 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.3x (extra forward pass)

**Rationale**: Feed model's own previous prediction as additional input. Allows iterative refinement and consistency in predictions.

**Implementation**:
- First forward: pred_v1 = model(x, t, prev_pred=None)
- Second forward: pred_v2 = model(x, t, prev_pred=pred_v1.detach())
- Loss on pred_v2 only
- 50% of time use null prev_pred for stability

**Key Papers**: "Analog Bits: Generating Discrete Data using Diffusion Models with Self-Conditioning" (Chen et al., 2023)

---

## 7. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +1-3 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.02x (memory only)

**Rationale**: Stabilizes training and improves generalization by maintaining smoothed version of model weights. Standard technique in diffusion models.

**Implementation**:
- Maintain shadow model: θ_ema = decay · θ_ema + (1-decay) · θ
- Use θ_ema for evaluation and sampling
- decay = 0.9999

**Key Papers**: Standard in all modern diffusion models

---

## 8. **Noise Schedule Optimization** ⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +1-3 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.0x (no overhead)

**Rationale**: Linear interpolation z_t = t·x1 + (1-t)·x0 might not be optimal. Learned or cosine schedules can improve training dynamics.

**Implementation**:
- Cosine schedule: t_effective = cos(0.5π · t)
- Or learned schedule: t_effective = MLP(t)
- Apply to interpolation: z_t = t_effective·x1 + (1-t_effective)·x0

**Key Papers**: "Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021)

---

## 9. **Gradient Clipping + Warmup** ⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +0.5-2 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.0x (no overhead)

**Rationale**: Stabilizes early training and prevents gradient explosions. Warmup allows model to find good basin before aggressive learning.

**Implementation**:
- Gradient clipping: clip gradients to max_norm=1.0
- LR warmup: linear warmup from 0 to lr over 1000 steps
- Cosine decay after warmup

**Key Papers**: Standard optimization practice

---

## 10. **Stochastic Depth (DropPath)** ⭐⭐⭐
**Projected PSNR Gain**: +0.5-2 dB
**Training Overhead**: 1.0x (regularization)

**Rationale**: Randomly drop entire transformer layers during training. Acts as ensemble and prevents overfitting, especially important for small synthetic datasets.

**Implementation**:
- Drop entire residual paths with probability p
- Linear schedule: layer_i drop_prob = i/num_layers · max_drop_prob
- max_drop_prob = 0.1
